# Firefox

Ashen is available for download on the
[Firefox Addon Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ashen/).
This is the recommended way to install because you will get updates
automatically.

You may also download and directly install the
[theme.xpi](https://codeberg.org/ficd/ashen/raw/branch/main/firefox/theme.xpi) file
directly.
