# Base16

[ashel.yaml](./ashen.yaml) contains a Base 16 compliant specification of Ashen.
Please note that Ashen was not designed with Base 16 in mind â€” I am not very
familiar with the format, and I do not have a good process for testing it.
Contributions improving the Base 16 scheme are very welcome.
