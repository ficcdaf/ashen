The recommended way to install the theme is to use foot's `include` directive.
Download [ashen.ini](https://codeberg.org/ficd/ashen/raw/branch/main/foot/ashen.ini) and
edit `foot.ini`:

```ini
# Must be an absolute path.
include=~/path/to/ashen.ini
```

Alternatively, you may copy the contents of `ashen.ini` into you `foot.ini`
file.
